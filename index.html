<h1>Webring-a-ding-a-ding-ding</h1>
<p>Scring-a-ding-a-ding-ding! This is the official HQ page of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring>webring</a> of Fennaixelphox, created for my friends to link each other's sites together!<br>
Sorry it's kind of boring right now. We're just getting started. Once everything is all set up I'll focus more on making this site pretty and whatnot. <br>
If you'd like to join us, click this link to <a href="{{'/join'|relative_url}}">join the webring!</a>
<p>If the ring is broken, please <a href={{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/new>submit an error report on GitHub</a>.

<h2 id=members>Members ({{site.data.members.size}})</h2>

<li><a href="{{member.url | xml_escape}}">{{member.name | xml_escape | newline_to_br}}</a>{% endfor %}
